The System Requirements Specification (SRS) for an Event Management System outlines the necessary features, functionalities, and technical requirements for creating a platform that helps event organizers manage and run events efficiently. The document includes:

Introduction: Describes the purpose and scope of the system, its intended users (event organizers, attendees), and key functionalities (event creation, registration, scheduling, etc.).

Overall Description: Provides an overview of the systemâ€™s functions, user roles (admin, event manager, attendee), operating environment, constraints, and assumptions.

Functional Requirements: Details the specific features such as:

Event creation and management.

Registration and attendee management.

Venue and schedule management.

Payment processing (if applicable).

Notifications and reporting.

Non-Functional Requirements: Focuses on performance, security, usability, scalability, availability, and backup/recovery needs.

External Interfaces: Describes the user interfaces (web-based, responsive), integration with third-party services (payment gateways, email/SMS providers), and hardware/software requirements.

The SRS serves as a roadmap for the development of the Event Management System, ensuring it meets both functional and non-functional goals while providing a seamless experience for organizers and attendees.
